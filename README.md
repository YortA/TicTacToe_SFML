# SFML_TicTacToe
 SFML TTT

The game is fairly simple and uses basic pixel sprites.

## At A Glance
- Made with SFML (see documentation here: https://www.sfml-dev.org/documentation/2.5.1/)
- MiniMax recursive function utilized for computer AI turns
- Use of objects and forward declarations (no inheritance)

## Known bugs
1. Game sometimes crashes on first player input (function inside of AI.cpp causes it)
2. AI isn't very smart -- could use tweaks in its minimax algorithm
